### Example for the use of the Sc2AutoObserver to simulate an observer for a replay

How to use:
To build this example the paths of the libs and includes of the sc2api have to be set. After building the executable make the following call in the command console:
`ExampleObserver.exe "C:\Users\D\Documents\StarCraft II\Replays\Multiplayer\Interloper LE (655).SC2Replay"`

### Known bug:
* The program crashes on exit.
* Only the perspective of one player.
